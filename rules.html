            <p style="font-size: 12pt; color: gold;" >Keep your case, which holds an unknown amount,

            <h3>How to Play:</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 10pt;"><strong>Select Your Case: </strong>At the very beginning of the game, 
                you will choose one case. This will be your case for the entire duration of the game and you 
                are entitled to whatever is in it, should you keep it for the full game.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 10pt;"><strong>Open Cases: </strong>Each round, you will choose 5 cases to be 
                eliminated by clicking on them. There, the amount in each case will be revealed and that amount
                will no longer be up for play. <strong">(The lower, the better. Aim to 
                find cheap cases!)</strong></p>
            <p style="font-size: 10pt;"><strong>Banker's Offer: </strong>After each round of eliminations, the 
                Banker will make an offer based on the remaining unopened cases. The offer is a cash value to 
                buy out your game.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 10pt;"><strong>Deal or No Deal? Deal: Accept the Banker's offer and 
                end the game with the amount offered.<br>No Deal: Reject the Banker's offer and continue playing, 
                eliminating more cases</strong></p>
            <p style="font-size: 10pt;">If you reach the end, rejecting all offers, you will be given the choice
                to switch your case with the last one available or keep yours and open it. Whatever you have, 
                you win!</p>
